<h2>The Snippets</h2>

<h2>Javascript Snippets</h2>
<h3>1. Day calculator</h3>

This code snippet is simply a converter which will take a date and convert it using the inbuilt getDay()
function. It then contains a Switch case on the Date variable which will assign the actual day to the day variable.

<h2>Shell Scripts</h2>

<h3>1. git-init-already-exists.sh</h3>
This script is to be used when you have created a folder and ran git init but the upstream and the remote havent been set up yet.

<h3>2. git-init-clean.sh</h3>
This script is to be used when a folder for your project has been created but you havent yet ran git init.

This script will run git init and will create a readme file. It will then ask you for your remote and will commit the readme, push and set the upstream to origin / master.
